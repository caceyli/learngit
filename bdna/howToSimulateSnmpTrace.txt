1. Prepare the environment:
   a. install jdk6 or above;
   b. download vxsnmpsimulator201. (D:\lihhgithub\learngit\bdna\qaTools\vxsnmpsimulator201.zip)

2. install vxsnmpsimulator: (on unix would be better, if do on windows, smb trace will type windows first)
   a. unzip the zip to /usr/local/vxsnmpsimulator;
   b. modify simulator.conf. (eg: jdk/jre location)
   b. copy simulator.conf to /etc/verax.d (create it if it's nonexisted).
   c. cp simulatord to /etc/init.d (for service start)
   d. give executive permission to the following files: (chmod a+x)
      /etc/init.d/simulatord
      /usr/local/vxsnmpsimulator/conf/stop,vlan_up,vlan_down

3. Edit device.conf.xml. (set bind ip and whice device file you want to use)

4. start the simulatord service.
   a. service simulatord start/stop/console
   b. /etc/init.d/simulatord start/stop/console

5. test with snmp commands: (can use 9.102)
   a. snmpwalk -v 2c -Oq -c public 192.168.8.115:161 1.3.6.1.4.1.741
   b. snmpwalk -v 2c -Oq -c public 192.168.8.115:161 IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress.1
   c. test credentials on UI, if the device file format is right, test will succeed. (right format: 6 and 7 can't be missed)

6. The firs row in file is very important, BDNA discover types device on level 1 based on this record: (snmp Level 1 trace)
   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: Cisco IOS Software, CE520 Software (CE520-LANBASEK9-M), Version 12.2(37)EX, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc5)  Copyright (c) 1986-2007 by Cisco Systems, Inc.  Compiled Wed 12-Sep-07 12:19 by weiliu

7. OID is also very important. Each of device has its own OID. (reference: https://thwack.solarwinds.com/thread/14592?start=105&tstart=0)
   a. Cisco CE520 OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.932
   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.932

   b. Cisco Catalyst 4500 OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.917 
   .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.1.917
