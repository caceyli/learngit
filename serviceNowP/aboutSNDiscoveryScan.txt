   a. Service-now Test Instance: http://bdnaintegration.service-now.com
   b. Login: bdna/bdna
   c. To setup your mid-server, use credential: bdna_mid/bdna_mid
2. dowload midserver from https://bdnaintegration.service-now.com -->MID Server-->Downloads to D:\caceyftp\serviceNowP\midServer\
3. copy D:\caceyftp\serviceNowP\midServer\mid.2015-04-06-2300.windows.x86-64.zip to the server: 192.168.8.232
4. unzip the installer to C:\ServiceNow\MID Server1\agent
5. modify the C:\ServiceNow\MID Server1\agent\conf.xml as following. (4 place)
       
   a. Find the <parameter name="url" value="https://YOUR_INSTANCE.service-now.com"/> element and change the value to the URL of your instance.
   b. Enter the MID user credentials in the mid.instance.username and mid.instance.password parameters. By default, the MID Server, uses basic authentication for SOAP messages. The password value is also encrypted authentication.
   c. Find the <parameter name="name" value="YOUR_MIDSERVER_NAME_GOES_HERE"/> element and change the value to define the name of your MID Server.

            this value to provide the URL of your organization's Service-now instance. -->
       <parameter name="url" value="https://bdnaintegration.service-now.com/"/>

	   <!-- If your Service-now instance has authentication enabled (the normal case), set 
            these parameters to define the user name and password the MID server will use 
            to log into the instance.  -->
       
       <parameter name="mid.instance.username" value="bdna_mid"/>
       <parameter encrypt="true" name="mid.instance.password" value="bdna_mid"/>
	
       <!-- Defines the name by which your MID server is known on the Service-now instance.  
            Edit this value to provide the name you want, or leave it blank and the MID server
            will make up a name. -->
       <parameter name="name" value="BDNA_FP_CACEY_DEV"/>
