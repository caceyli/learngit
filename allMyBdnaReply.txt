############## BDNA-12557_start ##############
Hi Ken, 

  Did you scan against vm121rh with non oracle user (eg: bdna)? If yes, I think that's reasonable and should be just a limitation. 

Because in the oracle environment on vm121rh, I found that there is one special setting "ORACLE_HOME in under oracle user home '/home/oracle' ", which would leading to only oracle user and root user can access it and Other user has no privilege to access it. So if you use user 'bdna' to do scan against vm121rh, you would not get what you expected (e.g. oracle level 2 data were not collected successfully). 

PS: Usually we do not set oracle_home under oracle user home. 

Here is my test process: 

I have done two scan test, one with user 'oracle', the other one with user 'bdna', the formal test get normal result (level 2/3 data were all collected), the latter can't collect all level 2 data (only installation home were collected through process info), as the user 'bdna' does not has privilege to access oracle_home on vm121rh. 

1. test1 with oracle user to do scan (using Discover/201609 seq): 
   a. level 2 credential: oracle/oracle. 
   b. level 2 scan result: all oracle Level 2 data (oracle installation) was discovered. 
   c. level 3 credential: c##test_user/bdna 
   d. level 3 scan result: all oracle Level 3 data was discovered. 

2. test2 with non oracle user to do scan (using Discover/201609 seq): 
   a. level 2 credential: bdna/bdna. 
   b. level 2 scan result: not all oracle Level 2 data (eg: version, enterprise) was discovered. 
   c. cause: the non oracle user (bdna) does not has privilege to access oracle_home on vm121rh. 

3. I checked the oracle installation on vm121rh and found the ORACLE_HOME is under oracle user home "/home/oracle": 
[bdna@vm121rh ~]$ ll /u01 
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 16 Sep 28 20:56 /u01 -> /home/oracle/u01 
[bdna@vm121rh ~]$ 

[bdna@vm121rh ~]$ ll /u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/ 
ls: cannot access /u01/app/oracle/product/12.1.0/: Permission denied 
[bdna@vm121rh ~]$ 


  In conclusion, I think ORACLE_HOME setting would be the basic cause for your scan result and that's just a limitation not a bug. Now, I close this bug first. 

Please check your scan user first and If you confirm this issue is not caused by ORACLE_HOME setting or you have any other different opinions, please reopen this bug and provide us more information. Thanks.

In this case, 'module -i' probably just can work on cs(Collection Store) but not on factbase.  As the Daman custom FP contains code for report, 'module -i' on factbase will cause other unknow problems, we had met such case before.

In case any problem in factbase, a better choice is to build a new Enterprise sequences as a hotfix based on Dec sequence code + Daman custom FP, so that it can work normally in both cs/fb.

Customer can apply this hotfix through cs/factbase upgrade From Dec Enterprise Sequence or directly from their existing Enterprise Sequence if they haven't applied Released Dec Enterprise.

Hi Dimitry, 

  I have one thing need to make clear, as I can't launch the UI now: 
  Do you mean you can login the UI and can't open the report on UI? 

  I have checked the logs on vm118rh and found something abnormal in dw.log: 
  it looks like that reports were not refreshed completely after factbase upgrade to 201612. The report refreshing process was unexpectedly ended, as can be saw from the last line of dw.log: 

  [ com.bdna.dw, INFO,11-30 16:49:53] Starting OP(BUILDDW_DATA,10,[G10_DEV_TEMP_ID_0_A, G10_DEV_TEMP_ID_0_MROS],[0],82) 

  We have ever done tests(fb upgrade 201605 to latest, 201609 to latest) on GZ offices environment, result is normal. We suspect your issue may be caused by "refreshing not completed". Only after we confirm this can we go further. 

  So, Can you manually re-do Refresh Report operation? Or, can I do that on this server (vm118rh) now? 


Thanks 
Cacey

Hi Dmitry,

  I have tested the Seq201612 with Discover 772 GA platform. The normal result of all tests done so far indicates that the Seq201612 is compatible with 770,771 and 772 GA. I have updated the Seq201612 Release Notes for 770,771 and 772. You can get them from the attachment or Github server: https://github.com/BDNA/Sequence-Documentation.


  In Seq201612, there are 12 bugs, as can be saw from the filter (fixVersion = Seq201612), among which, 6 bugs are tracker bugs and only the following three bugs have code changed:

.BDNA-1138  (mentioned in Release Notes)
.BDNA-11220 (mentioned in Release Notes)
.BDNA-12555(This bug issue is same as BDNA-12610,and BDNA-12610 is closed)

QA needs to verify the code for the two bugs mentioned in Release Notes. As the code for BDNA-12555 has been verified in BDNA-12610 by QA and we found it has been included into the latest 2016-09 Release Enterprise sequence, we think, there is no need to repeate the same verification and So it wasn't mentioned in Seq201612 relase notes. 


Sincerely
Cacey

############ Nmap_Sudo_start #############
Hi Lucille,
 
From the script output file returned from customer, the size of sudo file they used to run nmap command is:
 
cmd13 ls -l /usr/bin/sudo 2>&1 result:
---s--x--x 1 root root 123832 Jul 31 2014 /usr/bin/sudo
 
The file size in my system (the first is the system sudo (size 123832), the second is the script provide by customer(size 1218))
[root@VMST9102 ~]# ll /usr/bin/sudo
---s--x--x. 1 root root 123832 Oct 7 2013 /usr/bin/sudo
[root@VMST9102 ~]# ll ./sudo
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1218 Mar 23 13:16 ./sudo
 
From the size of sudo file, I think customer's real sudo command they used to run nmap is still the system sudo not the script.
 
Here are 2 solutions based on the information we get from customer's environment through script:
 
Solution 1: If customer want to use their own sudo script instead of the system sudo in BDNA discover scan task, they should use the script to overwrite the system sudo file first, otherwise, the sudo script will not be used at all by default. The instruction to overwrite the system sudo file:
1) login with root user
2) mv /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/sudo_bp
3) copy the sudo script to /usr/bin/
4) chmod a+x /usr/bin/sudo
5) setcap cap_net_raw+ep /apps/opt/bdna/static_nmap/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64
(ps: according to the customer's sudo script, the real nmap command to be executed is /apps/opt/bdna/static_nmap/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64)
6) re-run the nmap command with sudo, it should work normally now:
sudo $BDNA_HOME/nih/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64 -n -sS -PI -PS80,135,445,3389 -O -F 10.133.6.164 2>&1
7) If the above command succeeded, please ignore this step, otherwise, please run the following 2 command with their bdna user (bdnasvc) and return the output of command in step 6) and this step:
$BDNA_HOME/nih/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64 --privileged -n -sS -PI -PS80,135,445,3389 -O -F 10.133.6.164 2>&1
/apps/opt/bdna/static_nmap/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64 --privileged -n -sS -PI -PS80,135,445,3389 -O -F 10.133.6.164 2>&1
 
Solution 2: If customer want to continue using the system sudo, they need to do some setting about sudo user:
1) visudo (run this command as root user):
 
//Comment out the "Defaults requiretty" line
#Defaults requiretty
//Add a line to turn off requiretty for the user
Defaults:bdnasvc !requiretty
 
//Comment out the env_reset line
# Defaults env_reset
// Add a line to turn off env_reset for the user
Defaults:bdnasvc !env_reset
 
//Add following line under line 'root ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL'
bdnasvc ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
 
ps: this step, you can refer to discover installation instruction step 8 at http://wiki.bdnacorp.com/index.php/Discover_7.7_Production_Machine_Setup :
 
**********
step 8. Fix /etc/sudoers
%visudo
// Comment out the "Defaults requiretty" line
# Defaults requiretty
// Add a line to turn off requiretty for the user
Defaults:<username> !requiretty
// Comment out the env_reset line
# Defaults env_reset
// Add a line to turn off env_reset for the user
Defaults:<username> !env_reset
// Comment out PASSWD
root ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
bdna ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
oracle ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
**********
 
2) login as bdnasvc user and check it's sudo privilege with command 'sudo -l', you may see the words like:
User bdnasvc may run the following commands on this host:
(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
3) re-run the nmap command with suodo, it should work normally now:
sudo $BDNA_HOME/nih/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64 -n -sS -PI -PS80,135,445,3389 -O -F 10.133.6.164 2>&1
4) If the above command succeeded, please ignore this step, otherwise, please return the output of step 4) and command 'sudo -l' to us and provide the file /etc/sudoers in their environment for us.
 
Thanks
Cacey

Hi Deepa/Lucille,
 
I think that's the sudo user permission which resulted to nmap command failure.
I have reproduced this issue by configuring user 'bdna' as a sudo user but not giving it root privileges:
1. visudo
2. add/modified following line under line 'root ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL'
bdna    ALL=() NOPASSWD: ALL
3. login as bdna user and check it's sudo privilege with command 'sudo -l', you may see the words like:
User bdna may run the following commands on this host:
    (bdna) NOPASSWD: ALL

To solve this issue, we should configure user 'bdna' as a sudo user and give it root privileges with following steps:
1. visudo (run this command as root user)
2. add/modified following line under line 'root ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL'
bdna ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
3. login as bdna user and check it's sudo privilege with command 'sudo -l', you may see the words like:
User bdna may run the following commands on this host:
(root) NOPASSWD: ALL
4. re-run the nmap command, it should work normally now.
5. if step 4 work well, please create a new level 1 scan task.
 
Following is my tests result:
 
Test case 1: reproduce the nmap permission issue.
1. configure user 'bdna' as a sudo user but do not give it root priviledges.
2. check sudo privilege with command 'sudo -l'
[bdna@VMDC8245 ~]$ sudo -l

3.check nmap command:
[bdna@VMDC8245 ~]$ sudo $BDNA_HOME/nih/Nmap/src/nmap.Linux.RHEL6.x86_64 -n -sS -PI -PS80,135,445,3389 -O -F 192.168.8.12 2>&1

Warning: You are not root -- using TCP pingscan rather than ICMP
You requested a scan type which requires root privileges.
QUITTING!
[bdna@VMDC8245 ~]$
 
Test case 2: fixed the nmap permission issue.
1. configure user 'bdna' as a sudo user and give it root priviledges.
2. check sudo privilege with command 'sudo -l'
[bdna@VMDC8245 ~]$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for bdna on this host:
