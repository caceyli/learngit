Invisible（Hunter Hayes演唱单曲）

中英歌词
Crowded hallways are the loneliest places for outcasts and rebels 拥挤的走廊是反叛者和不合群的孩子们最孤独的地方
Or anyone who just dares to be different 以及那些只是敢於有所不同的人们
And you've been trying for so long to find out where your place is 你一直努力找到自己的位置
But in their narrow minds, 但在他们狭隘的思想中,
there's no room for anyone who dares to do something different 没有允许别人与众不同的空间
Oh, but listen for a minute 哦，但是听我说几句
Trust the one who's been where you are 信任那个曾与你处境相同的人
wishing all it was was sticks and stones 每天只能期待一顿毒打和冷嘲热讽
Those words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone 这些话深深扎痛你但你并不孤独
You're not invisible 你不是透明人
Hear me out, 听我说完，
there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now 你生命的意义远不止你现在的痛苦感受
Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be 当你回望起这些日子，一切痛苦都会
Invisible 不复存在 
Oh, invisible 哦，看不见
So your confidence is quiet 你的自信是默然无语
To them quiet looks like weakness but you don't have to fight it 对他们来说沉默就是软弱，但别和他们争斗
Cause you're strong enough to win without a war 因为你强大的内心使你不用战争便成为胜利者
Every heart has a rhythm, let yours beat out so loudly 每个人心中都有一种韵律，让你的心灵大声跳动
That everyone can hear it, yeah, promise you don't need to hide it anyone 让每个人都能听到，是的，保证你无需隐藏它
Oh, and never be afraid of doing something different 哦,决不要害怕与众不同
Dare to be something more 敢於做更多
Trust the one who's been where you are 信任那个曾与你处境相同的人
wishing all it was was sticks and stones 每天只能期待一顿毒打和冷嘲热讽
Those words cut deep but they don't mean you're all alone 这些话深深扎痛你但你并不孤独
You're not invisible 你不是透明人
Hear me out, 听我说完，
there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now 你生命的意义远不止你现在的痛苦感受
Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be 当你回望起这些日子，一切痛苦都会
Invisible 不复存在
These labels that they give you just 'cause they don't understand 他们给你贴的标签只是因为他们不理解
If you look past this moment, you'll see you've got a friend 当你回望过去你会发现你有一个朋友
Waving a flag, for who you are, and all you're gonna do 挥舞著旗帜，为了真正的自己，和你所有的所作所为
Yeah, so here's to you and here's to anyone who's ever felt invisible 是的，这首歌献给所有称感觉自己没有存在感的人们
Yeah 是啊
And you're not invisible 和你不是透明人
Hear me out, 听我说完，
there's so much more to life than what you're feeling now 你生命的意义远不止你现在的痛苦感受
Someday you'll look back on all these days and all this pain is gonna be 当你回望起这些日子，一切痛苦都会
Invisible 不复存在
It'll be invisible 将会不复存在[1]
