Back To December - Taylor Swift

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
Small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleepin
Stayin up playing back myself leavin
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your lovin all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin
Probably mindless dreamin
If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

This is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you
Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
all the time
