because of you（Kelly Clarkson演唱歌曲）

I will not make the same mistakes that you did 我不会重蹈你的覆辙
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery 我不会让自己满心悲苦
I will not break the way you did 我不会违背你的意愿
you fell so hard 你饱受了煎熬
I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far 我已经尝尽痛苦，决不让它越陷越深
Because of you 因为你
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 我从来不偏离生活的轨道太远
Because of you 因为你
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt 我学会了尽力远离伤害
Because of you 因为你
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me 我发现很难相信自己，也很难相信周围的每一个人
Because of you 因为你
I am afraid 我感到害怕
I lose my way 我迷失了方向
And it‘s not too long before you point it out 在你为我指明道路之前不久。
I can not cry 我不能哭泣
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes 因为我知道在你眼中那是一种懦弱
I’m forced to fake a smile, a laugh everyday of my life 以后的每一天 我都会强颜欢笑
My heart can't possibly break 我的心也许无法再碎
When it wasn't even whole to start with 因为本来就是一颗破碎的心
Because of you 因为你
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 我绝不会远离我的轨道
Because of you 因为你
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt 我学会了尽力远离伤害
Because of you 只因为你
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me 我发现很难相信自己，也很难相信周围的每一个人
Because of you 因为你
I am afraid 我感到害怕
I watched you die 看着你的心渐渐死去
I heard you cry every night in your sleep 每一夜 我都能听见你在睡梦中哭泣
I was so young 我太年轻
You should have known better than to lean on me 你应该知道的而不是选择依赖我
You never thought of anyone else 你从未想过别人的感受
You just saw your pain 你只知道自己的痛苦
And now I cry in the middle of the nightfor the same damn thing 现在 因为那该死的同样的事情 我躲在深夜里哭泣
Because of you 因为你
I never stray too far from the sidewalk 我绝不会远离我的轨道
Because of you 因为你
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt 我学会了尽力远离伤害
Because of you 因为你
I tried my hardest just to forget everything 我尽最大的努力只想忘记这一切
Because of you 因为你
I don’t know how to let anyone else in 我的心无法让任何人驻足 
Because of you 因为你 
I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty 我为那一颗荒芜的心感到愧疚
Because of you 因为你
I am afraid 我感到害怕
Because of you 因为你
Because of you 只因为你
