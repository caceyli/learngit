Generating Oracle LMS 3PTV Output
After completing all Oracle Level 3 Collection Tasks you can use the following steps to generate the Oracle LMS
3PTV output in the format specified by Oracle LMS.
Note: These steps must be completed against the Collection Store schema. Oracle LMS 3PTV output generation is
not currently supported against a FactBase schema.
In addition to the steps used to export the results, after refreshanalytics has been completed in step 1, the LMS data
may be viewed directly using the Analytics application. All Oracle LMS related reports may be found under the
Analytics application in a folder named ¡®Oracle Licensing¡¯.
To generate Oracle LMS 3PTV Output from a Collection Store:
The following steps must be completed while logged on to the primary BDNA Discover Linux component as the user
bdna. The export will target the schema currently connected to the Collection Store instance, as specified in the file
$BDNA_HOME/conf/connection.properties. If export from an instance other than the currently connected
instance is desired, update the connection.properties in order to specify a different target schema.
1. Connect to the Collection Store and run refreshanalytics using the bdna shell
2. Execute the following shell script to generate the Oracle LMS 3PTV output:
$BDNA_HOME/conf/bcp_store/EnterpriseSequence/bin/ExtractLMS3PTVOutput.sh
This script takes one optional argument that may be used to specify a target output directory. If no directory
argument is passed to the script the current directory will be the target for the output files. Example:
[bdna@server tmp]$ cd $BDNA_HOME/conf/bcp_store/EnterpriseSequence/bin/
[bdna@server bin]$ sh ./ExtractLMS3PTVOutput.sh -f /tmp
Usage: ExtractLMS3PTVOutput.sh [-f target_folder]
where:
[-f target_folder] is the directory path where the LMS 3PTV output files get
saved. (optional)
