About 3. We made it work after changing ownership chown -R bdna:bdna /tmp/ModularCollFind/ :

This happened because /tmp/ModularCollFind/ was already created by root user before you run script again as non-root user. In this sitiuation, it's epxected that non-root user can't access that directory and running the script failed.


Considering about this situation, I have a confusion, I think there is something needed to make clear first: 


I found the following information in the Discover_7.7.0_Administrator_Guide.pdf (page 164):

The Modular Collection Infrastructure consists of three major components:
?An XML file that tells BDNA Discover that there is an additional file to use during scanning and where the file is located.
?Shell scripts that must be run as the root user on every Linux machine that is to be scanned, for which modular collection is to be used.
?The file that was generated by running the shell scripts discussed above.


As the pdf indicated, we must run all shell scripts as root user. (I am very sorry i didn't notice this point earlier)
Howerver, in fact, the script invokeFindScript.sh doesn't surport root user.

Here is my confusion:
All shell scripts should be run as root user or non-root user?


Here are 2 solution to fix this:
1. to remove the code which requires to run invokeFindScript.sh as non-root user to allow root user to run invokeFindScript.sh.
2. To modify the instruction in Discover_7.7.0_Administrator_Guide.pdf requiring using only non-root user to run scripts.


Which solution would be more appropriate? Can anyone give any sugestion? Thanks.
